# The Endless Kaizo IronMON Challenge

The Endless Kaizo IronMon challenge is a [Pokémon Randomizer](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-Pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases)
Challenge run inspired by [iateyourpie](https://www.twitch.tv/iateyourpie) and the IronMON Challenge.
Endless Kaizo IronMON was created by [Selipnir](https://www.twitch.tv/selipnir)

This ruleset was designed to be used with the Ironmon Tracker and the Endless Kaizo Ironmon Extension. You don't need to use them, but they help a lot.

Instead of a single run this is now a nearly endless run! Think of it like a standard Kaizo IronMON run, but with a set starter in the lab for yourself. You start with the highest BST Pokemon and as you win runs you go down the list (Skip Shedinja, nobody needs that).

This challenge is designed exclusively around the FireRed/LeafGreen game. Feel free to adapt the rules to your preferred game.

## FAQs

> <b>Q</b>: Why?

> A: I like the idea of going from the lab to the champion with a single mon, and then working through the whole Pokedex like that.

> <b>Q</b>: Can I change the order?

> A: Of course. Don't sweat the small stuff. We encourage the highest to lowest BST for the most unique experience, but your order can be unique.

> <b>Q</b>: I just beat the game with Latias, Started a new run with Ho-oh and died. Do I have to start over with Latias again?

> A: Nope. Latias is off your list, now it is all Ho-oh until you win, etc.

> <b>Q</b>: What settings in the tracker should I use?

> A: Whatever you like. Personally I suggest turning off the ball picker since you won't use it. 

> <b>Q</b>: What tracker extensions do you suggest?

> A: SmackerTracker might be a fun one.

> <b>Q</b>: What else should I use?

> A: I suggest the Quality of Life patch by Dr. Maple and anything else that helps you relax and enjoy the challenge
