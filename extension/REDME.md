This was created with FireRed/LeafGreen. It was built and tested on FireRed 1.2 with BizHawk and Windows

## First Time Setup

1. When setting up the tracker for the first time create a new profile in the Ironmon Tracker. Don't worry about the New Run setup right now, we will come back to it
2. When the extension activated click on the Options for the extension.
3. You will set the following items
- Base RNQS will be the base RNQS file the extension should use for all rules except placement of the Pokemon on the right of the table in the lab
- Generate will generate a RNQS file to be used. You will want to keep this filepath for later
4. Save the Options and go back to the New Run settings in the Ironmon Tracker
5. Set your randomizer and ROM like you would for any other run, use the filepath you were given for the RNQS file
- The RNQS file will be in the same place as your base file, but with _EK at the end of the filename
6. Start a new run in the tracker and have fun!
